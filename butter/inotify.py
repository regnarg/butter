    If a dir argument is provided this call will not recursively watch the directories
    due to limitations in inotify's API. if you wish to watch directories recursively
    you will need to recurs it yourself and add the watches manually

    Warning: if using this function to watch a file or dir repeatedly you may miss events
    due to a race condition, consider using the Inotify object instead to get all the 
    file events
    
    This function will not watch directories recursively if given a directory as an 
    argument and will only return events occurring in that directory
    
    Arguments
    ----------
    :param str path: the file/dir to watch for events to occur on
    :param int events: The inotify IN_* events to watch path for

    Returns
    --------
    :return: The file descriptor representing the signalfd
    :rtype: int
